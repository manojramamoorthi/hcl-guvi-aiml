Problem Description

The system should evaluate creditworthiness, identify financial risks, suggest cost optimization strategies, and recommend suitable financial products from banks and NBFCs. Advanced features include automated bookkeeping assistance, tax compliance checking, financial forecasting, working capital optimization, and integration with GST returns and banking APIs. The platform must handle multiple business types, provide industry-specific benchmarking, generate investor-ready financial reports, and offer multilingual support for regional business owners. The solution must maintain high security standards, ensure regulatory compliance, and provide clear visualization of financial metrics for non-finance business owners.
